# rmpc

Listens for mpd on the default port on localhost. Uses cava.

Config is made specifically for this setup:

- Forced Kitty Graphics Protocol usage
- In vertical split on 1920x1080 there is exactly one line for the queue
- Lyrics directory is the same as music directory in mpd
- mpd should be configured to output fifo file for cava
